## UX Design

To attract English speaking visitors to the UNESCO Roman City in Aquileia. It was one of the most important cities in the Roman Empire.
Visitors have the opportunity to see the key historic sites of the Roman Forum, the River Port and the main Market square. The historical information is next to the images to provide a cohesive structure.
A timeline offers users an easy to read timeline detailing key important dates.

The purpose of the website is to provide visitors information so that they can plan their visit in advance. There is a map of the area, the contact details, admission price, opening times and a contact form for any further information.

The primary user of the site will be English speaking visitors to the region. For visitors to the major cities of Venice and Trieste, Aquileia is ideally suited for those visitors venturing further afield who have an interest in historic, namely Roman culture. The site is very well maintained and much of the architecture is complete in structure. Aquileia is a rare and beautiful UNESCO heritage site.
The user will be able to plan a visit, to really take in the full beauty of the site.

 __Aims__

- To offer visitors the opportunity to experience this rare historic cultural Roman archeology.
The site itself is close to me and I am very passionate about this period of history.

- To give visitors all the information they need to enjoy their time in the region

- To promote the area in general. Aquileia is very close to the major tourist cities of Venice and Trieste and many tourists do not know about the area.

- Provide high quality images of the Roman architecture.

- The navigation will be minimalistic to create clear intuitive prompts to the user.

- To contain useful information for the visitor/user.

- To detail historic information so that the user can understand what is on offer at the site.

- To include a timeline with key data and dates about the historic site.

- Further to provide a contact form for visitors to get in touch.

- To offer a map of the location, with information on how to get to Aquileia by car and public transport.

- To provide information about access to the Roman site.

- To give arrival information such as car parking, admission price and opening times.

- Links in the footer to the social media platforms will be provided.

- Finally a call to action visitor contact form for those users requiring further visitor information.

__Background Color__

Header and Footer both use ` #e96e14 `, a golden orange color to complement the Italian imagery palette selected from the hero image aided by the [eyedropper tool Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions).
Body uses a background color white ` #fafafa ` to contrast well with the charcoal font-color ` #3a3a3a `. Used the color light blue ` rgb(152, 207, 246, 0.5) ` with opacity to draw the reader's attention to the content without distracting from the information. The color was chosen for the background to compliment the colors of the sky in the images used.

[Colorspace](https://mycolor.space/) used to check the palette works together. 

__Font Color__

H1, h2 and h3 headings used the color ` #e96e14 ` to complement the logo.
The body text used the ` #3a3a3a ` to enable easy viewing for the reader against the background therefore the text stood out well without causing the reader to strain to read it. 

__Border Color__

The border color charcoal ` #3a3a3a ` used to compliment the body font color.

__Form Color__

The Contact form uses the background of light beige ` rgb(222, 233, 238, 0.9) ` to contrast with the background image of The Forum, the input fields are beige ` #F5F5DC ` to make the content text input area stand out on the background. The border color again uses the color charcoal ` #3a3a3a `.

__Fonts__

- Volkhov font is used for headings and the logo to style them to the roman topic of the website. The font Lato used for the body text to give a clean look for the user.
